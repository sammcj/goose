# ============================================================================
# PROMPT - Detailed Workflow with Extension Integration
# ============================================================================
# Step-by-step instructions showing how Memory and Developer extensions work together

prompt: |
  You are analyzing test coverage for the project at {{ project_path }} to generate
  intelligent test suggestions that improve coverage to {{ coverage_threshold }}%.
  
  # =========================================================================
  # STEP 1: LOAD CONTEXT FROM MEMORY
  # =========================================================================
  # Purpose: Retrieve previously learned patterns to inform current analysis
  # Extension: Memory (loads first)
  
  Step 1: Load Testing Patterns from Memory
    First, retrieve any previously learned testing patterns for this project:
    - Retrieve key "{{ project_path }}_testing_style" - the team's preferred test structure
    - Retrieve key "{{ project_path }}_gap_patterns" - common gap patterns from past analysis
    - Retrieve key "{{ project_path }}_preferred_frameworks" - frameworks the team uses
    - Retrieve key "testing_best_practices" - general testing best practices library
    
    If this is your first time analyzing this project, you'll start fresh
    and build up knowledge over time. Store any retrieved patterns in your
    context for use in the generation steps below.
  
  
  # =========================================================================
  # STEP 2: DETECT TEST FRAMEWORK
  # =========================================================================
  # Purpose: Identify which testing framework is used in this project
  # Extension: Developer (file scanning)
  
  Step 2: Detect Testing Framework
    {% if test_framework == "auto" %}
    Since test_framework is set to 'auto', detect the framework automatically:
      a) Search for test file patterns in {{ project_path }}:
         - .test.js, .spec.js, __tests__/*.js files → JavaScript/Jest
         - _test.py, test_*.py, tests/*.py files → Python/pytest or unittest
         - *_test.go, *_test.go files → Go/go-test
         - *.test.ts, *.spec.ts files → TypeScript/Jest
      
      b) Check for configuration files:
         - package.json with "jest" dependency → Jest
         - pytest.ini, setup.cfg, pyproject.toml → pytest
         - go.mod → go test
         - unittest imports in test files → Python unittest
      
      c) Report the detected framework with confidence level
         Example: "Detected: pytest (high confidence - found pytest.ini)"
    {% else %}
    Use the specified framework: {{ test_framework }}
    Verify that test files for {{ test_framework }} exist in {{ project_path }}
    If no test files found, suggest creating a basic test structure for {{ test_framework }}
    {% endif %}
  
  
  # =========================================================================
  # STEP 3: ANALYZE CURRENT TEST COVERAGE
  # =========================================================================
  # Purpose: Understand current state and identify coverage gaps
  # Extension: Developer (code scanning and analysis)
  
  Step 3: Analyze Current Test Coverage
    Scan the project at {{ project_path }} for test coverage information:
    
    a) Test File Inventory:
       - Find all test files matching the detected/specified framework
       - Count total number of test files and individual test cases
       - Calculate ratio: lines of test code vs lines of application code
       - List the main test directories found
    
    b) Coverage Data Collection:
       - Look for coverage reports in common locations:
         * Python: .coverage, coverage.xml, htmlcov/, .coverage.*
         * JavaScript: coverage/, coverage.json, coverage-final.json
         * Go: coverage.out, coverage.html
       - If coverage reports exist, parse them to get:
         * Overall coverage percentage
         * Per-file coverage breakdown
         * Uncovered line numbers
       - If NO coverage reports found:
         * Estimate coverage by analyzing test file imports and function calls
         * Identify source files that have no corresponding test files
         * Note: "No coverage data found - will identify gaps by analysis"
    
    c) Gap Analysis:
       - Compare current coverage to target {{ coverage_threshold }}%
       - Identify files with coverage below threshold
       - List top 10 files/modules with lowest coverage
       - Focus analysis on {{ focus_areas }}
       - Prioritize gaps by impact:
         * Critical: Core business logic with <50% coverage
         * High: Error handling and edge cases with <70% coverage
         * Medium: Helper functions and utilities with <80% coverage
  
  
  # =========================================================================
  # STEP 4: IDENTIFY GAPS USING LEARNED PATTERNS
  # =========================================================================
  # Purpose: Use Memory's patterns to make smarter gap identification
  # Extension: Both (Developer analysis + Memory context)
  
  Step 4: Identify Testing Gaps (Using Learned Patterns)
    Using both the coverage analysis AND the learned patterns from Step 1:
    
    a) Apply learned patterns to current analysis:
       - If Memory contains testing style preferences, apply them
       - Check if current gaps match previously identified gap patterns
       - Consider team's preferred test granularity (unit vs integration)
       - Note patterns like: "Team prefers testing error cases separately"
    
    b) Categorize and prioritize missing tests by {{ focus_areas }}:
       {% if focus_areas == "all" or "core-logic" in focus_areas %}
       - Core Logic Gaps:
         * Functions/methods with no test coverage
         * Business logic paths not exercised by tests
         * Main workflows missing test scenarios
       {% endif %}
       
       {% if focus_areas == "all" or "edge-cases" in focus_areas %}
       - Edge Case Gaps:
         * Boundary conditions (empty inputs, max values, null/undefined)
         * Unusual input combinations
         * Race conditions or timing-sensitive code
       {% endif %}
       
       {% if focus_areas == "all" or "error-handling" in focus_areas %}
       - Error Handling Gaps:
         * Exception paths not tested
         * Error callbacks or error states
         * Validation failure scenarios
       {% endif %}
       
       {% if focus_areas == "all" or "integration" in focus_areas %}
       - Integration Gaps:
         * API endpoint tests
         * Database interaction tests
         * External service mock/integration tests
       {% endif %}
    
    c) Create prioritized list:
       - Rank gaps by: (impact × likelihood × ease of testing)
       - Mark which gaps align with learned patterns
       - Identify quick wins (high impact, easy to test)
  
  
  # =========================================================================
  # STEP 5: GENERATE TEST SUGGESTIONS
  # =========================================================================
  # Purpose: Create specific, actionable test recommendations
  # Extension: Developer (code generation using learned context)
  
  Step 5: Generate Test Suggestions
    For each identified gap, create specific test suggestions:
    
    a) For each high-priority gap:
       - Write a clear, descriptive test name following framework conventions
       - Explain what this test should verify
       - Provide the expected test structure for {{ test_framework }}
       - Include a brief code example showing the test skeleton
       - If learned patterns exist, match the team's testing style
       
       Example format:
       ```
       Test: test_user_authentication_with_invalid_credentials
       Purpose: Verify that authentication fails gracefully with wrong password
       Priority: Critical (core-logic, error-handling)
       Estimated effort: 10 minutes
       
       Code example for {{ test_framework }}:
       [Framework-specific test code here]
       ```
    
    b) Include implementation context:
       - Why this test is important (coverage gap, risk mitigation)
       - Which code path it covers
       - Expected assertions and edge cases to test
       - Dependencies or mocks needed
    
    c) Organize suggestions by priority:
       - Critical (must-have for {{ coverage_threshold }}% target)
       - High (important for robust coverage)
       - Medium (nice-to-have, improves confidence)
       
    d) Limit initial suggestions:
       - Provide top 5-10 most impactful tests
       - Note: "Implement these first, then re-run for more suggestions"
  
  
  # =========================================================================
  # STEP 6: CREATE TEST TEMPLATES (Optional)
  # =========================================================================
  # Purpose: Generate ready-to-use test file templates
  # Extension: Developer (template creation)
  
  Step 6: Generate Test Templates
    {% if generate_templates == "true" %}
    Create test file templates that developers can immediately use:
    
    a) For files with NO existing tests:
       - Create a complete new test file template
       - Include proper imports for {{ test_framework }}
       - Add setup/teardown methods if applicable
       - Provide 2-3 example test functions with placeholders
       - Match the coding style from Memory if available
       
    b) For files with SOME existing tests:
       - Generate test functions to add to existing test files
       - Match the existing test file's style and structure
       - Include comments indicating where to insert the new tests
    
    c) Include in templates:
       - Proper test file naming (matching framework conventions)
       - Required imports and dependencies
       - Mock/fixture setup if needed
       - Clear TODOs for values to fill in
       - Example assertions showing expected patterns
    
    d) Output format:
       - Provide templates as copyable code blocks
       - Include file paths where templates should be saved
       - Add instructions for running the tests
       
    Example output:
    ```
    # File: tests/test_user_authentication.py
    # Framework: pytest
    # Purpose: Tests for user authentication module
    
    import pytest
    from myapp.auth import authenticate_user
    
    def test_authentication_success():
        # TODO: Replace with actual test data
        user = {"username": "test_user", "password": "correct_password"}
        result = authenticate_user(user)
        assert result.success is True
        assert result.user_id is not None
    
    def test_authentication_invalid_password():
        # Test critical error path
        user = {"username": "test_user", "password": "wrong_password"}
        result = authenticate_user(user)
        assert result.success is False
        assert result.error == "Invalid credentials"
    ```
    {% else %}
    Template generation is disabled. Providing suggestions only (see Step 5).
    {% endif %}
