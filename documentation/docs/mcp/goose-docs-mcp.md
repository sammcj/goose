## Example Usage
GitMCP allows you to convert any Git repository into a Goose extension. The Goose Docs MCP Server is a great example of this, as it provides a way for Goose to answer questions about itself.

Let's ask Goose to create a recipe for us! It will use the Goose Docs MCP Server to find the relevant information.


### Goose Prompt

```
hey Goose, I want to create a recipe for automated code review that my development team can use. Can you look at the Goose documentation to understand the recipe format, then create a recipe that:


1. Reviews pull requests for:

- Code quality issues and best practices
- Security vulnerabilities
- Missing unit tests
- Performance concerns

2. Should be parameterized so teams can customize:

- Programming language (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Minimum test coverage threshold
- Specific coding standards to enforce

3. Should output structured results that can be parsed by CI/CD systems

Please research the recipe format first using the Goose Docs extension, then create a complete recipe file with proper YAML structure, parameters, and any needed extensions. 
Make it something a development team could immediately use in their workflow.
```


### Goose Output

:::note Desktop

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive automated code review recipe based on the Goose documentation research. Here's what I've built for your development team:

#### üìã Recipe Overview

The **Automated Code Review** recipe (`automated-code-review.yaml`) provides:

#### ‚úÖ **Core Review Areas**
1. **Code Quality & Best Practices** - Architecture, naming, complexity, documentation
2. **Security Vulnerability Assessment** - OWASP Top 10, input validation, auth issues
3. **Test Coverage Analysis** - Missing tests, coverage thresholds, test quality
4. **Performance Concerns** - Bottlenecks, algorithm complexity, resource management
5. **Technical Debt Assessment** - Refactoring needs, maintainability issues

#### üîß **Parameterization Features**
- **`programming_language`** - Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust, TypeScript, etc.
- **`min_test_coverage`** - Customizable threshold (default: 80%)
- **`coding_standards`** - PEP8, ESLint, Google Style Guide, company-specific
- **`security_focus`** - Basic, standard, or comprehensive security analysis
- **`performance_analysis`** - Enable/disable performance review
- **`exclude_patterns`** - Skip certain files/directories

#### üìä **Structured CI/CD Output**
The recipe outputs a comprehensive JSON structure with:
- **Overall quality score** and recommendation (approve/request changes/reject)
- **Categorized issues** with severity levels and specific file locations
- **Security vulnerabilities** with CWE IDs and remediation steps
- **Test coverage metrics** and missing test recommendations
- **Performance concerns** with optimization suggestions
- **Technical debt assessment** with effort estimates
- **CI/CD metadata** for pipeline integration

#### üöÄ **Usage Examples**

#### Basic Usage:
```bash
goose run automated-code-review.yaml \
  --repository_path ./my-project \
  --programming_language Python
```

#### Advanced Usage:
```bash
goose run automated-code-review.yaml \
  --repository_path ./my-project \
  --programming_language JavaScript \
  --min_test_coverage 85 \
  --coding_standards ESLint \
  --security_focus comprehensive \
  --exclude_patterns "*.test.js,dist/*,node_modules/*"
```

#### üîß **CI/CD Integration**

The structured JSON output makes it perfect for CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Run Code Review
  run: |
    goose run automated-code-review.yaml \
      --repository_path . \
      --programming_language ${{ matrix.language }} \
      --output review-results.json

- name: Process Results
  run: |
    # Parse JSON results for pipeline decisions
    RECOMMENDATION=$(jq -r '.review_summary.recommendation' review-results.json)
    if [ "$RECOMMENDATION" = "reject" ]; then
      exit 1
    fi
```

#### üìÅ **File Structure**

The recipe is saved as `automated-code-review.yaml` in your current directory and includes:
- Proper YAML structure following Goose recipe format
- Comprehensive parameter definitions with defaults
- Built-in developer extension for file system access
- Detailed JSON schema for structured output
- Template syntax for parameter substitution

Your development team can immediately start using this recipe by placing it in their project repositories and customizing the parameters for their specific needs!
